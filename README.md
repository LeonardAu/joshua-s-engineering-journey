This repository contains **Leonard Joshua Bulawan’s E-Portfolio** for **ENG205: Introduction to Engineering** (B.S. Chemical Engineering, University of Santo Tomas). The e-portfolio is organized around the **ABET Student Outcomes (SO1–SO7)** and presents artifacts, reflections, and evidence mapped to each outcome.
